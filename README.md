# 481_Fall_2023: Artificial Intelligence Final Project

# **Dog/Cat Image Recognition and Breed Prediction System**

**Developed By: Anjali Patel, Azucena Jimenez, Khang Pham**

As a team, we concluded that we wanted to alter our approach to our recognition system. Transitioning from "Where's Waldo", we had chosen to have our system recognize animal, their breed, and color. Since then, in order to use well defined dataset, we pivoted to identyfying the breeds of dogs and cats. Though our project changed scope, the intent remained the same: develop an accurate image recognition system.  

Overall Goal: With the use of supervised learning artificial intelligence, our goal is not only to identify the animal's breed in a given picture, as well as print out three facts about the animal. 

**Problem and Solution:**
Dog lovers, admirers, trainers and aficionados occasionally have difficulty distinguishing dog breeds. There are a myriad of breeds and crossovers existing, and especially kids, and potential dog owners, deciding the best dog can be a challenging task. This artificial intelligent chatbot will assist in determining the breed of a dog, and even cats. Next time you take a picture of a cute dog walking down the street, or see a dog in a commercial, a quick picture uploaded to our chatbot will assist with this determination of breed. Taking a step further, this model is just as helpful for kids trying to learn about different dogs and cats, and even for owners by helping determine the type of breed as well as a few facts about their animal.
