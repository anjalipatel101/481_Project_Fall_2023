# 481_Project_Fall_2023: Animal Recognition System 

As a team, we concluded that we wanted to alter our approach to our recognition system. Transitioning from "Where's Waldo", we have chosen to have our system recognize animal, their breed, and color. 


With the use of supervised learning artificial intelligence, our goal is to identify the animal in a given picture. More details to be specified at a later time.
